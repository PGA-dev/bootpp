# Guitar Buying Manufacturing Specs Guide


## Portfolio Project Perspectives
One of the most interesting questions I get asked as a guitar instructor is: "what paramaters are relevant to buying a guitar?" The answer, like most issues in life, varies with the needs of the student, or musician asking the question. While most beginner players don't really need a lot of information to get them started, too much overkill on specifics killing their enjoyable new hobby, they do need solid technical data to inform them and educate them to make future musical decisions and purchases. Advanced, or pro-level players, often need a great deal more information on each instrument, and a way of comparing relevant brands and models for their particular musical needs. For these reasons I have decided to attempt a manufacturer-driven specification guide to electrical guitars for my Bootstrap project.
